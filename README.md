# Malicious Link Classification with Machine Learning

# Description:
This project uses machine learning binary classification models to classify URLs as malicious or benign. The dataset includes various features extracted from URLs, such as domain age, length, and presence of special characters, which are used to train and evaluate the models. The objective is to build an accurate model that can effectively distinguish between malicious and safe URLs.

# Key Features:

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature extraction from URLs.
- Model Development: Building binary classification models using Python's scikit-learn library.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization: Visualizing model evaluation results and ROC curves.

# Technologies Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

# Usage:
- Clone the repository.
- Install the required libraries (requirements.txt provided if applicable).
- Open and run the Jupyter notebook (Malicious_link_prediction_.ipynb) to see the complete workflow or check out the scripts (train_model.py, evaluate_model.py) for specific tasks.
